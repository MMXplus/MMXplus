## Hi there
- 👋 I’m @MMXplus. Although I've been here a while, it's mostly been lurking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning.  I'm basically a n00b with a decent abilty to understand various coding languages but hardly ever get a chance to actually work on anything.
- 💞️ I work in the field of Arcchitecture, love photorealism/hyperrealism and creating portaits in pencil/charcoal on paper, and enjoy karaoke!
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting started, like, in general. Making my long defunked PetNet automatic pet feeder functional. Purchased at a thrift store, long ago, with every intention of making it work if I could... and now my cats are at the point in their lives where they can no longer eat kibble but I'd still like to get it set up! I've seen some promising projects here but just don't know where to start.
- 👀 I’m interested in squashing bugs.
- 👯 I’m not currently looking to collaborate on anything in particular but I'm not opposed to the idea.
- 💬 Ask me about anything you'd like. Disclaimer: If you ask a stupid question, I reserve the right to aswer accordingly.
- 📫 How to reach me? Hmmm... info@mmxplus.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I identify as an ND Polymath. My ADHD is only occassionally checked by my OCD. Yes... I'm weird.
